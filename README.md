# Self-Driving-Car-Model
This project has been made to make the concept of self driving car familiar to everyone in the world before it actually arrives in developing countries like mine i.e. INDIA. Recently we had participated in state level competition at GMRT,Pune in Maharashtra,India and we won the 4 rank for the same. 
We have implemented features such as lane end detection,lane line detection,object detection and Road sign detection such as stop sign.
To implement these features we have used canny edge detection,perspective view transform and for detecting road signs we have used image classifier to train the data.We have used Open CV libraries and implemented the code in C++.
The current hardware consists of 
Master device-Raspberry pi 3B
Slave device-Arduino Uno
Raspicam imx 219-8MP
motor driver l298N
4 motors 
car chassis
FUTURE WORK:WE have faced a lot of processor lag so we have decide to used NVIDIA Jetson nano and have also decided to change the programming language to python.
